#Top Priority:
- ~~Charge the data format so it is not order dependant.~~
- ~~Parse a book into real data ~~
- ~~add bar chart of character mentions~~
- add cumulative character mentions by page
- ~~end line when character is no longer mentioned~~
- ~~merge overlaping intervals or have some other way to handle the issues they cause~~
- resolve issue with some intervals being lost if the have size is set too high.

#Medium Priority:
- Eliminate group gaps
- Clicking on a group will subset so only those characters are shown
- Add some form of adjustment to prevent misleading overlap.
- Have checkboxes to choose characters.
- Have slider to set page size

#Stretch Goals:
- Dot lines when characters are not present.
