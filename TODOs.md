#Top Priority:
*Charge the data format so it is not order dependant.
*Parse a book into real data
*add histogram of character mentions
*add line graph of character mentions by page
*end line when character is no longer mentioned

#Medium Priority:
*Eliminate group gaps
*Clicking on a group will subset so only those characters are shown
*Add some form of adjustment to prevent misleading overlap.

#Stretch Goals:
*Dot lines when characters are not present.
