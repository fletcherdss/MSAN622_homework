#Top Priority:
- ~~Charge the data format so it is not order dependant.~~
- ~~Parse a book into real data ~~
- add histogram of character mentions
- add line graph of character mentions by page
- ~~end line when character is no longer mentioned~~
- merge overlaping intervals or have some other way to handle the issues they cause

#Medium Priority:
- Eliminate group gaps
- Clicking on a group will subset so only those characters are shown
- Add some form of adjustment to prevent misleading overlap.

#Stretch Goals:
- Dot lines when characters are not present.
