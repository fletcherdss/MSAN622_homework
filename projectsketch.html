	                The data for this project will be based upon the contents of
	                <a href ="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page"> Project Gutenberg </a>.
	                Project Gutenberg is a collection of public domain ebooks.
	                Note that some of these books may still be under copyright outside
	                of the United States. 
                    See the <a href ="https://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Terms_of_Use">
                        terms of use </a> for more details. 
                    The <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/feeds/rdf-files.tar.bz2">
                        complete catalog </a> can 
                    also be downloaded.                   
                    It is licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"> 
                        GNU General Public License </a>.
                    I plan on the visualization being based on data 
                    aggregated from that data set. 

                </p>

                <p>
                    I choose this data because I wanted to work with a text data set. 
                    Project Gutenberg has an extensive collection, is in the public domain, 
                    and is cleanly formatted. While visualizing individual books is one option, 
                    the collection is extensive enough that visualizations could be done 
                    across books. I would be interested, for example, to see if
                    it would be possible to make a time series by publishing date.

                </p>

                <p>
                    In case the data is unavailable it 
                    is
                    <a href="./data/rdf-files.tar.bz2"> mirrored here</a>. 
                </p>

                        <p>
                        The data set it self is a rather large collection of RDF files. 
                        Too large to process in D3. Rather I will extract the data I need 
                        using the python library RDFLib, depending the the visualizations.
                        One useful statistic for analysing text is word frequencies. I will
                        probably compute a number of JSON objects with the frequencies of
                        different words for individual books, as well as a across categories.
                        </p>
                
                        <p>
                            I also plan to employ some tools for EDA, likely in python or R.
                            As D3 plots can be timeconsuming to create I will likely
                            experiment with what makes for a good visualization using
                            something like ggplot. Other tools like plotly or 
                            tablau might also prove useful.

                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <h2 class="page-header"><a name="featuresc"></a>Planned Techniques. </h2>
                        <p>
                        I plan on implementing 3 types of visualization. First I seek to 
                        compare individual books, choosen from a drop down menu, on
                        various statistics such as vocablary and length. Individual Genres 
                        can also be compared in this manner. Group bars would probably
                        well suited to this task, though small multiples might be another option.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also am interested in doing a time series visualization, 
                            showing how language changes over time. 
                            I would probably find some words that are interesting and plot the
                            frequency of a given word across all books published in a given
                            year. I may also stratify by Genre. 
                        </p>
                        

                        <p>
                            The final visualization will be more focused on
                            understanding the topic of individual books. One
                            aspect I will explore is mapping cooccurance of characters
                            in works of fiction. I might try to do a visualization such 
                            with the x-axis the word position on the book, and 
                            the y axis the occurance of characters names. I might 
                            try to follow a visualization like this one from 
                            <a href="https://xkcd.com/657/large/"> XKCD </a>, 
                            though it would be difficult to get time as accurate. 

                        </p>

                       
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <h2 class="page-header"><a name="featuresc"></a>Planned Techniques. </h2>
                        <p>
                            Most of my planned interation will be around allowing the user
                            to choose which data to emphasize. The user will have
                            the option of choosing which words they want to visualize,
                            as well as which books or collections of the books they 
                            are interested in.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the visualization of occurance of characters, the 
                            user will have the option of moving character lines
                            to make the visualization less messy. It would
                            be impossible to automatically arrange the 
                            data as neatly as it is in the XKCD visualization
                            but if the user could drag to re-organize things
                            might be more readable.

                            y-axis is arbitrary. The lines can be dragged by the user
                            to improve the quality of the visualization.
