        <div class="media-body">
            <p>
                The primary plot is a visualization of which characters are present
                (mentioned by name) in works of fiction. The inspiration of 
                this plot was a graph from <a href="https://xkcd.com/657/large/"> XKCD </a>. 
                The XKCD graph shows 
                presence of characters by time in various movies. It would be impossible
                to determine simultaneous events just from reading a book, so instead
                the graph shows what pages characters are mentioned on and when 
                multiple characters are on the same page. By default a page is 80 lines
                but the page size is adjustable with the slider.
            </p>

            <p>
                The data is encoded as a series of points with the fields
                being page number, character name, and whether or not the character
                has been mentioned on that page. The main pre-attentive attribute
                utilized my by this visualization is grouping. The eye naturally
                settles on the places were lines are next to each other. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The main way this graph can be misleading is that lines 
                can some times appear to be part of a group when they are not. Also
                It if only one character is present in the scene it can be difficult to 
                tell. These are only issues when the groups are centered. Another
                way in which the graph can me misleading is that when the page size is
                high characters can appear to be present in a scene even if they 
                have left the scene. This is inevitable, given the subjective nature of
                the data. Overall though the lie factor is low, and interactive controls
                enable the user to mitigate these issues.
            </p>

            <p>
                Data-ink ratio is good. Having the lines visible 
                both when a character is present and when they are not
                is somewhat redundant, but this is only a small
                waste of ink in exchange for ease of tracing out individual
                characters across the pages. Overall the ink used
                is comparable to what would be used in a small multiples 
                graph, which is a more conventional way this data would be show (each line
                being it's own small multiple). 

            </p>

            <p>
                Data density is reasonably high. Whiles this 
                isn't as dense as a heatmap it does still display 
                a fair amount of information in a reasonably small space.
            </p>

            <p>
                The visualization excels at draw attention to when characters
                enter or or exit the action. The visualization also illustrates
                which characters have the most interaction, and shows
                which characters are present for the largest part of the book.

            </p>

        <div class="media-body">
            <h2 class="page-header"><a name="about"></a>Techniques: Bar Chart</h2> 
        
            <p>
                The top graph only shows if a character is mentioned, not how often.
                I included two more graphs to supply that information. One can 
                quickly glean that Richard Shelton is the protagonist of this book from
                the next two graphs. The data from this graph was computed directly from
                the raw data, and not the data used for the first graph. Name and number
                of occurrences are the only variables. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The first graph is a simple bar graph, showing the total number 
                of times each character is mentioned. As you can see this particular book
                has a single protagonist. The other characters are mentioned by 
                name much less often.  This graph is intended to complement the 
                other graphs. Neither of the other graphs
                show total word counts, so the viewer will likely want to refer to this
                while checking the other graphs. 
                I experimented with both horizontal and vertical orientation
                and I think vertical is preferable as it "lines up" better with line graphs.
                 None the less, both orientations are
                available to the viewer. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Data to ink ratio is high, and lie factor is essentially zero. Data density
                isn't great because there is so much white space. This is in part the result
                of the book having a main protagonist. Color and position are encoding 
                the same information, though I would argue this is justified in order to make
                the graph consistent with the other to. Color enables this graph to double
                as a legend for the graph to it's right.

            <h2 class="page-header"><a name="about"></a>Techniques: Cumulative Percentage</h2> 
            <p>
                The Final graph is a cumulative percentage graph. The x axis is the page
                number and the y axis is the 
                cumulative percentage of mentions of a characters name by that page. Color
                is the character name.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lie Factor is minimal with the kind of graph. There is a 
                bit of monotone smoothing of the lines, but that is about it. 
                Data density is average.
                Line graphs do have a fair amount of white space. Data to ink ratio 
                is pretty good. Almost all ink is data.

            </p>

            <p>
                It 
                becomes even more apparent that Richard Shelton is a central 
                character as he occurs uniformly throughout the book. It also
                is apparent the Sir Daniel plays a central role.
                By contrast Bennet Hatch is mentioned mostly in the beginning and so is 
                less central to the story. The visualization also serves
                to distinguish between early characters, late characters, 
                and characters absent in the middle.

                    form of interactivity is the the adjustable page size. 
                    Adjusting the size of pages with the slider allows the user 
                    to strike a balance between readability and Lie Factor. If 
                    the page size is small then Lie Factor is low, while if the 
                    page size is large then the lie factor is high. Setting the page
                    size high is preferable if the user is trying to get a
                    big picture of the flow of the story, while a smaller page size 
                    allows them to see to details of when characters are mentioned.

                    Zooming by a brush/slider was planned but was not be 
                    completed by midnight tonight. Zooming allows the user to 
                    focus on specific sections of the action, and is a complement
                    to adjusting page size. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Filtering by character was also planned. As with zooming 
                    filtering allows the users to focus, but this time by character 
                    rather than page. Filtering allows users to investigate questions 
                    like how often specific characters occur together. 
                </p>

                <p>
                     The
                    User also has the option to put the grouped users either at the bottom of 
                    the graph or at the median of their starting positions. The former option
                    encodes more information as it enables the users to recognize when
                    only a single character is present. Also centering does risk having
                    users appear to be present if their starting position is in the center of the
                    group. Centering does look a lot better though, and significantly reduces
                    the amount of crossing lines. 
                    It was planned to have the user be able to manually move the lines
                    to further reduce clutter, but there wasn't time to implement this feature. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The User also has the option of having lines end once a character is no longer 
                    mentioned. This does not produce a very dramatic effect for this
                    visualization, and not many of the main characters are killed
                    or removed from action, or if they are they might still be
                    mentioned again. This could be interesting for visualizing a work like Game 
                    of Thrones though.

                The main feedback I considered was having the characters end 
                when the lines end. I elected to allow the user decide in this case,
                as the effect this will have depends a lot on the data. I has 
                had the suggestion to have absent characters be a faded color or a dashed line.
                I would have liked to implement this feature, but I did not have time to
                do so.

                The biggest challenge for this project was just handling the data. 
                Stripping the words out of the text proved to be pretty straight forward.
                All I had to do get the list of characters from Wikipedia 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Arrow:_A_Tale_of_the_Two_Roses#Characters"> Wikipedia </a>,
                add in a few alternative names for each character, and filter everything
                that wasn't a character name from each line. I wrote a simple python script
                which handled all that output everything in a JSON compliant text files
                <a href="https://github.com/fletcherdss/MSAN622_homework/blob/gh-pages/data/blackar.txt"> blackar.txt </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting the data into a form which could be used by d3 proved to be more difficult.
                The raw data was quite heterogeneous. I created a JavaScript library 
                <a href="https://github.com/fletcherdss/MSAN622_homework/blob/gh-pages/js/project.js"> project.js </a>
                which took significantly more time than I anticipated. JavaScript
                will often fail silently which meant it often took a while to get
                to the root of the problem. I can see moving forward that extensive 
                testing frameworks are necessary for any sort of JavaScript
                development, as often my data would fail to meet the specification
                I thought it had. 
                
            </p>
        
            <p>
                This was my first major JavaScript project, so there was
                still a fair amount of familiarizing myself with the language I
                had to do. Much of the functionality I was accustomed to with
                other languages doesn't exist in JavaScript though I
                found <a href="http://underscorejs.org/"> Underscore </a> to 
                be a big help filling in a lot of the features I am was looking for.

            </p>

            <p>
                Finally I found handling updating in D3 to be tricky. While it
                might be fairly straight forward to put together a static 
                page, as soon as you need to flexibility in what is displayed things start
                to break. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I also would have liked to compare different books as I had origionally intended. It 
                does take a fair amount of manual work to process book data though and I felt it would
                be better for focused my efforts elsewhere.

        <div class="media-body">
            <p>
                Perhaps the most surprising observation I made was how easy it is to identity 
                a protagonist using a cumulative percentage graph. Unlike all the other
                characters the protagonist had a pretty much constant slope for the entirety of the book. I
                was also surprised to see how often the main characters are mentioned in contrast to 
                the supporting characters. I imagine a lot of things things will vary from book to book though.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately I did not have time to upload more books as data, as the real value 
                of the primary visualization is in comparing the shape of various graphs to
                classify by genre. You can see this in the XKCD plot. Lord of the Rings is an epic with
                have huge number of characters and interweaving narratives. 12 Angry Men by contrast
                has 12 people in a room. The Black Arrow is a pretty straight forward medieval
                adventure novel. It has a single protagonist and the action revolves around them.

            <p>
                Besides D3, 2 external libraries were used, <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore </a>
                and <a href="https://github.com/turban/d3.slider"> D3.js Slider</a>. Underscore is a 
                general purpose JavaScript library which makes data manipulation easier. D3.js Slider is 
                a simple slider library with some premade slider tools. Much of the bootstrap HTML
                code was also prebuilt and modified by me.
            </p>

            <p>
                The rest of the JavaScript code was all my own work. Example code may have been consulted
                here or there, but to the best of my recollection none of the JavaScript contents
                of <a href="https://github.com/fletcherdss/MSAN622_homework/blob/gh-pages/js/project.js"> project.js </a>
                or <a href="https://github.com/fletcherdss/MSAN622_homework/blob/gh-pages/project.html"> project.html </a>
                were copied from external sources. A small amount of my code was borrowed, in heavily modified form
                from previous homework assignments, which may have been based on example code. The 
                <a href="https://github.com/fletcherdss/MSAN622_homework/blob/gh-pages/data/data.py"> 
                    python script </a> for 
                cleaning the data is also my own work.
